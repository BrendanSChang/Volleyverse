# Volleyverse

This is an Android application for the Volleyverse website.

## Current State

The application is currently able to load and refresh posts.

(Screenshots to be added later...)

## Next Steps

- Add a feedback activity
- Show a clean WebView to the user immediately (get rid of the lag from removing tags manually via javascript)
- Implement offline loading using WebView caching mechanisms
- Add push functionality and a settings activity to allow the user to control push subscriptions
- UI improvements
- Test on different platforms/versions
