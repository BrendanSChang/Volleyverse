# Volleyverse

This is an Android application for the Volleyverse website.

## Current State

The application is currently able to load and refresh posts.

(Screenshots to be added later...)

## Next Steps

1. Add a feedback activity
2. Show a clean WebView to the user immediately (get rid of the lag from removing tags manually via javascript)
3. Implement offline loading using WebView caching mechanisms
4. Add push functionality and a settings activity to allow the user to control push subscriptions
5. UI improvements
